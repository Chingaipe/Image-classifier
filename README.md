# ImageClassifier

This project is a clone of a project on [Angular in depth](https://blog.angularindepth.com/create-your-own-image-classifier-with-angular-and-tensorflow-js-5b1bc2391424).
It is an implementation of Tensorflow.js' [Mobilenet model](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/mobilenet) for image classification.

The application classifies images either uploaded or via the computer's webcam, giving the image's class name and probability.
